    "reasoning": "The documentation is mostly complete, but it lacks detailed descriptions for some parameters and return values. The accuracy of the descriptions is high, as they are factually correct and provide useful insights beyond just reading the code. Clarity is excellent, making it easy to understand for developers. Structure and organization are good, but could be improved with more headings and clear section divisions. Context enrichment is low because there are no external references or related architectural concepts mentioned.",
